Each week he went through my plans with a fine tooth comb and nothing was missed, my goals were met and he was available anytime via voice note, text or call. I have a scoliosis and was nervous about lifting weights but syxx created a plan that was tailored for me and improved my muscle balance. He made my whole experience fun with his banter and energy. I'd highly recommend him.",
